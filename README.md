# CircleTime
A browser-based tool to display a live graphical schedule, currnetly hosted [here](https://circletime.briankardon.net).

I have always had a terrible sense of time. At least one of my children inherited this. I find it very hard to get a sense of how the day's events are laid out in front of me, or to judge and remember amounts of time. Also, it was a struggle every morning to move my kids through the necessary morning schedule, especially on school days - it involved a lot of nagging and annoyance.

So, I created a tool to help with these problems. It provides a live visualization of your day's schedule in a circular format. It also provides optional voice notifications when events are starting and/or ending, with optional offset reminders.

Features:
- Schedule live-rotates, showing progress
- Zoom in and out to show the whole day, or a smaller window of time
- Voice notifications for start, end, and offset reminders
- Start notifications come with customizable randomized intro text, which by default is full of whimsical British slang.
- Choose any of the voices from your browser's selection for notifications
- Create schedule presets for different types of days to quickly load a template for the day's schedule

Thanks to my family for guiding the feature development and beta testing.
